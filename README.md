# 🛠️ CyberFang Tools

Welcome to **CyberFang**, a growing collection of custom-built offensive security tools, automation scripts, and red team utilities made for ethical hacking, penetration testing, and CTFs.

Each tool is written with simplicity, power, and stealth in mind — whether you're scanning networks, bypassing logins, or exploiting vulnerable systems, this arsenal will grow with me as I rise from beginner to elite.
